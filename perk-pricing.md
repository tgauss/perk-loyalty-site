Our onboarding and setup process is a collaborative, white-glove service designed to guarantee your program is built for success from day one. This one-time investment covers the strategic and technical work to design your program logic, configure your brand, integrate with your systems, and train your team, preventing costly issues down the line.

### What is the difference between a "Designated" and "Dedicated" Account Manager?
A **Designated Account Manager (Growth Tier)** is your consistent, named point of contact for strategy and support.
